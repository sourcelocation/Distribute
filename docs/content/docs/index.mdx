Distribute Project requires two 2 components to function: the DistributeApp (client) and Distributor (server).

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server
- Electricity ⚡️


## Step 1. Installing DistributeApp

To download the DistributeApp, visit the [official GitHub releases](https://github.com/ProjectDistribute/Distribute/releases). Choose the version that corresponds to your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). 

## Step 2. Installing Distributor

Distributor is the server component that works alongside DistributeApp to manage and sync your music files. It's currently only available for Linux (x86, arm64). To install Distributor, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Using the Installer Script
TODO

### Option 2: Manual Installation
1. Download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if you haven't already.
2. Create a directory for Distributor:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/distributor
    cd ~/distributor
    ```
3. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```bash
    nano docker-compose.yml
    ```
4. Add the following configuration to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
    ```yaml
    services:
      distributor:
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "8585:8585"
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/storage # You can specify your HDD here
          - ./data/db:/app/data/db # Preferably SSD
        image: sourcelocation/distributor:latest
        environment:
          - LISTEN_ON=0.0.0.0:8585
          - MEILI_URL=http://meilisearch:7700
          - MEILI_MASTER_KEY=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY:-masterKey}
        depends_on:
          - meilisearch
        networks:
          - distribute

      meilisearch:
        image: getmeili/meilisearch:v1.31
        container_name: distributor_meili
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "127.0.0.1:7700:7700"
        environment:
          - MEILI_MASTER_KEY=${MEILI_MASTER_KEY:-masterKey}
          - MEILI_LOG_LEVEL=warn
        volumes:
          - meilisearch_data:/meili_data
        networks:
          - distribute

    networks:
      distribute:
        name: distribute

    volumes:
      meilisearch_data:

5. Create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    echo "MEILI_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)" > .env
    ```
      
6. Start Distributor using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

7. The server is now running on `[::]:8585`, set up a reverse proxy with HTTPS using Nginx and Let's Encrypt for secure access. (Nginx Proxy Manager is recommended)

8. Access Distributor admin panel by navigating to `https://your-server-ip` in your web browser. Set up an admin account there before using Distribute App.


## Step 3. Connecting DistributeApp to Distributor

<Callout type="info" title="Server Setup Required">
  Don't have a server link? You need to set up Distributor first. Follow the instructions in Step 3 below to install Distributor on your server.
</Callout>

1. Open Distribute (App) on your device.
2. Go to the Settings tab.
3. Enter the address that is used to access Distributor (e.g., `https://distributor.example.com`). If you used the script installer, you will see it displayed at the end of the installation.
4. Log in using your credentials (cry about it if you don't have em, cause this is a beta and you literally can't create users yet).

Congratulations! You have successfully installed DistributeApp and Distributor. You can now start syncing and managing your music files across your devices.
