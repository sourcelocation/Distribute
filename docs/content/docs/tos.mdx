### 1. Nature of the Service
**DistributeApp** ("the Software") is a neutral technology platform designed to facilitate the streaming and management of self-hosted media libraries. The Software functions exclusively as a client-interface tool. The developers of the Software ("the Developers") do not host, index, provide, or control any media content whatsoever.

* **Zero Tolerance:** We reserve the right to terminate support or access for any user known to be utilizing the Software for illegal distribution or consumption of copyrighted works, to the extent technically feasible.

### 4. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Developers, their contributors, and affiliates from any claims, damages, legal fees, or liabilities arising out of your use of the Software, specifically including but not limited to claims of copyright infringement, unauthorized distribution, or violation of intellectual property laws.
